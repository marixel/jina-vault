### **stores energy in the cell**

![[ATP structure graph.png]]
- [[chemical energy]]
- [[the secret to life]]
- the extra phosphate in ADP may become an [[inorganic phosphate]]
- ### Uses in cell:
	- mechanical work
	- transport work
	- chemical work
- ## Origin: [[autotrophic]] in nature; produced by the body after taking in raw materials
	- ### $\ce{ADP + P -> ATP}$ (endergonic reaction)

## Function:
- generated via [[respiration]] (both [[aerobic]] and [[anaerobic]])
- [[phosphate bonds]] are unstable bc of [[phosphate group]] crowding (so bonds are weak)
- products of [[ATP]] [[hydrolosis]] ([[ADP]] + P) more stable than [[ATP]],

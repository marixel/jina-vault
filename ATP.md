title: ATP
### **stores [[energy]] in the cell**

![[ATP structure graph.png]]
- [[chemical energy]]
- [[the secret to life]]
- the extra phosphate in ADP may become an [[inorganic phosphate]]
- ### Uses in cell:
	- mechanical work
	- transport work
	- chemical work
- ## Origin: [[autotrophic]] in nature; produced by the body after taking in raw materials
	- ### $\ce{ADP + P -> ATP}$ (endergonic reaction)
	- composed of ribose

## Function:
- generated via [[respiration]] (both [[aerobic]] and [[anaerobic]])
- [[phosphate bonds]] are unstable bc of [[phosphate group]] crowding (so bonds are weak)
- products of [[ATP]] [[hydrolysis]] ([[ADP]] + P) more stable than [[ATP]]

### how does [[ATP]] release energy?
	[[High-energy bonds]]: **releases energy** when bond is broken
		A - P - ***P ~ P*** ([[ATP]]) --> A - P - P + ***P*** (ADP)
			**phosphate group is separated**
		considered high-energy bc won't likely reform after [[hydrolysis]] + ADP + P is more stable than ATP bc [[electrons]] are in more stable position
	**$\ce{ATP^-^4 + H2O}$ --> $\ce{ADP^-^3 + HPO4^-^2}$**
	[[free energy]] = negative; [[catabolic]] and [[exergonic]] reaction

Q: What is the equation for ATP hydrolysis?
  - A: ATP^-4 + H2O â†’ ADP^-3 + HPO4^-2

Q: What is the free energy change in ATP hydrolysis?
  - A: The free energy change in ATP hydrolysis is negative, indicating a catabolic and exergonic reaction.

 Q: Where does ATP originate?
	A: ATP is autotrophic in nature and is produced by the body after taking in raw materials.

Q: How does ATP release energy?
	A: ATP releases energy by breaking its high-energy bonds, leading to the formation of ADP and inorganic phosphate.

Q: What happens when an extra phosphate is added to ADP? 
	A: it may become an inorganic phosphate

**how does a cell do work?**

#biology #cell-biology #cells 
### **[[ATP]]**
- 3 phosphate groups ()
![[ATP structure vs nucleotide structure.png]]
#### 3x as many [[phosphate group]]s as a [[nucleotide]]

### how does [[ATP]] release energy?
	[[High-energy bonds]]: **releases energy** when bond is broken
		A - P - ***P ~ P*** ([[ATP[[]]) --> A - P - P + ***P*** (ADP)
			**phosphate group is separated**
		considered high-energy bc won't likely reform after [[hydrolosis]] + ADP + P is more stable than ATP bc [[electrons]] are in more stable position
	**$\ce{ATP^-^4 + H2O}$ --> $\ce{ADP^-^3 + HPO4^-^2}$**
	[[free energy]] = negative; [[catabolic]] and [[exergonic]] reaction
**energy goes into production of nutrients and cell function**(?)

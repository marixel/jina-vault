#### happens to *all* cells (plant & animal)
10-step [[anaerobic]] or [[aerobic]] process involving the breakdown of [[glucose]] into 2 [[pyruvate]]
processes produce much more [[ATP]] ([[catabolic]] process)
#### [[energy]] is added throughout process
#### begins and ends in [[cytoplasm]] (bc no [[energy]] is required)

### 2-part, 10-step process:

#### part 1: [[energy]]/[[ATP]] investment stage
1.  [[ATP]] to [[ADP]] when [[phosphate group]] invested
	- [[hydrogen]] electrons transferred into phosphate with help of the [[enzyme]] ****[[hexokinase]]** (carbon-6 [[energy]] investment/[[glucose]])
	- glucose —> glucose 6-phosphate
2. glucose 6-phosphate isomerized into [[fructose]] with [[enzyme]] **isomerase**
	- fructose 6-phosphate forms
3. fructose 6-phosphate undergoes [[phosphorylation]] to form fructose 16-biphosphate (“bi” bc [[ATP]] invested again)
4. new [[ATP]] investment broken down into [[ADP]]; another phosphate group added with enzyme **phosphofructokinase** (having to do with high energy and [[phosphate group]]s)
	- 6-carbon, biphosphorylated substance
5. fructose biphosphate broken down into two components:
	- [[dehydroxyacetone phosphate]] (pretty useless for the cell when not converted)
		- unconverted: 3-carbon substance (glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate)
		- finishes glycolysis + respiration
		- enzyme __ converts glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate into dehydroxyacetone phosphate, which can be used by cell
		- state of [[equilibrium]] established
			- when G3P put into rest of [[glycolysis]], [[dehydroxyacetone phosphate]] moves in direction of G3P until it’s all converted to G3P

disorganized info: during [[glycolysis]], [[hydrogen]] is removed and (something else) is undergoing [[reduction]]

first stage summary:
- glucose doubly phosphorylated, split into 2 parts, first of which splits into 3-carbon molecule

#### phase 2:

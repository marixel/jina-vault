involved in [[respiration]]
combo of [[reduction]] and [[oxidation]] (process involving changes in charge via electron transfers)
#### [[reduction]] and [[oxidation]] *always* happen at the same time

#### [[energy]] is a product of this kind of reaction bc
- atoms of low electronegativities will not be broken from their bonds but will be attracted to atoms with high electronegativities
- low electro [[atoms]] move closer to high electro [[atoms]] (low attraction --> high attraction)
- high [[potential energy]] --> low [[potential energy]] ([[energy]] released!)

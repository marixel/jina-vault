### the process in which [[ATP]] is generated from the breakdown of organic molecules

### goal: transfer of energy stored in bonds of large, complex molecules to [[ATP]]

### steps (generally):
1. [[glycolysis]]: happens to ***all*** cells; glucose broken down by enzymes to release energy (inducing [[spontaneous]] reaction) to make ATP
	- broken down into [[pyruvate]] ($\ce{C6H12O6 -> (2)3C Pyruvate}$)
	- #### [[anaerobic]] [[respiration]] stops at first step of [[glycolysis]]
	- #### [[aerobic]] [[respiration]] will continue to step 10 of [[glycolysis]
